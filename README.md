# Endless Flighter

This is a game for my AI/ML experiment. Just run it with `yarn dev` and open
`localhost:1234`. Use `a` to steer left and `s` to steer right. Try to avoid
obstacles. If you hit an obstacle, you just fly though it.

It's meant for teaching a neural network to avoid obstacles.

It's nothing fancy :)
